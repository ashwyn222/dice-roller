# PWA Icons

The icon files in this directory are placeholders. For production, you should replace them with proper icons:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192px icon for PWA manifest
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512px icon for PWA manifest  
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180px icon for iOS home screen
- `favicon.svg` - SVG favicon (already created)

You can generate proper icons from a single source image using tools like:

The icons should feature a dice design that matches your app's branding.
